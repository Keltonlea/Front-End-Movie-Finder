## User Story

AS A movie watcher
I WANT to check and compare movie ratings, trailers, plots, and more
SO THAT I can plan decide what movie to watch 


## Requirements



  * Application uses at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources)

  * Application uses client-side storage to store persistent data.

  * Application doesn't use JS alerts, prompts, or confirms (uses modals instead).

  * Application uses a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

  * Application is interactive (accepts and responds to user input)




## About The Project

As a group we want a site that displays relevant movie information so we can decide what movie to watch. When a movie titled is entered, the poster of the movie as well as the cast, plot, and movie ratings appear. The user is able to enter the movie title on a list of "movies to watch" so they do not forget. In the future we would like to be able to add comments to share with friends, in other words, add your own rating and read friend's reviews.
